        and specialty medical and dental services to uninsured, low-income residents.
        Who is Treated? Patients of our clinics are the working poor. They tend to
        earn just enough income to be ineligible for Medi-Cal coverage, yet do not
        receive health insurance through their employers and cannot afford to pay
        for “out-of-pocket” health insurance. Often these residents are forced to
        seek treatment at local emergency rooms and become saddled with medical bills
        that they are unable to pay. Samaritan House’s Free Medical Clinics fill this
        gap in healthcare access for the uninsured and save emergency room resources
        for emergencies. Professional Medical \u0026 Dental Volunteers Thanks to its
        innovative volunteer-based model of service, Samaritan House’s clinics are
        able to treat such a large number of patients with a very small paid staff.
        Almost all of the medical and dental doctors and assistants are volunteering
        their time free of charge. These individuals, either retired or currently
        practicing medicine and dentistry, want to serve their community in their
        limited spare time.","kind":"Human Services","latitude":37.468678,"longitude":-122.207057,"name":"Redwood
